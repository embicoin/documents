1. What is Storj?
Storj (pronounced: storage) aims to become a cloud storage platform that can’t be censored or monitored, 
or have downtime. Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows users
to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, 
public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, 
it will be way cheaper (10x-to-100x), faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.

Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, MetaDisk, 
and client app, DriveShare. It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage 
that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files. 
There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers,
or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.

To best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on users’ computers
before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted
and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of DriveShare nodes 
run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for Storjcoin X (SJCX).

The decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, a
nd because of the use of client-side encryption, only the end-users have access to their unencrypted files 
and encryption keys.
